=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BumpVersionAfterRelease - Bump module versions after distribution release

=head1 VERSION

version 0.018

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your code, declare C<$VERSION> like this:

    package Foo;
    our $VERSION = '1.23';

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [RewriteVersion]

    [BumpVersionAfterRelease]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

After a release, this module modifies your original source code to replace an
existing C<our $VERSION = '1.23'> declaration with the next number after the
released version as determined by L<Version::Next>.

By default, versions B<must> be "strict" -- decimal or 3+ part tuple with a
leading "v".  The C<allow_decimal_underscore> option, if enabled, will also
allow decimals to contain an underscore.  All other version forms are
not allowed, including: "v1.2", "1.2.3" and "v1.2.3_4".

Only the B<first>
occurrence is affected (unless you set the L</global> attribute) and it must
exactly match this regular expression:

    qr{^our \s+ \$VERSION \s* = \s* '$version::LAX'}mx

It must be at the start of a line and any trailing comments are deleted.  The
original may have double-quotes, but the re-written line will have single
quotes.

The very restrictive regular expression format is intentional to avoid
the various ways finding a version assignment could go wrong and to avoid
using L<PPI>, which has similar complexity issues.

For most modules, this should work just fine.

=head1 USAGE

This L<Dist::Zilla> plugin, along with
L<RewriteVersion|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion> let you leave a
C<$VERSION> declaration in the code files in your repository but still let
Dist::Zilla provide automated version management.

First, you include a very specific C<$VERSION> declaration in your code:

    our $VERSION = '0.001';

It must be on a line by itself and should be the same in all your files.
(If it is not, it will be overwritten anyway.)

L<RewriteVersion|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion> is a version provider
plugin, so the version line from your main module will be used as the version
for your release.

If you override the version with the C<V> environment variable,
then L<RewriteVersion|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion> will overwrite the
C<$VERSION> declaration in the gathered files.

    V=1.000 dzil release

Finally, after a successful release, this module
L<BumpVersionAfterRelease|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BumpVersionAfterRelease> will
overwrite the C<$VERSION> declaration in your B<source> files to be the B<next>
version after the one you just released.  That version will then be the default
one that will be used for the next release.

You can configure which files have their C<$VERSION> declarations modified,
with the C<finder> option. The default finders are C<:InstallModules> and
C<:ExecFiles>; other predefined finders are listed in
L<Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser/default_finders>.

If you tag/commit after a release, you may want to tag and commit B<before>
the source files are modified.  Here is a sample C<dist.ini> that shows
how you might do that.

    name    = Foo-Bar
    author  = David Golden <dagolden@cpan.org>
    license = Apache_2_0
    copyright_holder = David Golden
    copyright_year   = 2014

    ; tag as of "dzil release"
    [Git::Tag]

=head2 Using underscore in decimal $VERSION

By default, versions must meet the 'strict' criteria from
L<version|version.pm>, which does not allow the use of underscores.

If the C<allow_decimal_underscore> options is set to true, you may
use underscores in decimal versions.  In this case, the following line will
be added after the C<$VERSION> assignment to ensure the underscore is
removed at runtime:

    $VERSION =~ tr/_//d;

Despite their long history on CPAN, the author does not recommend the use
of decimal underscore versions with Dist::Zilla, as Dist::Zilla supports
generating tarballs with a "-TRIAL" part of the name as well as putting a
C<release_status> in META.json â€“ both of which prevent PAUSE from indexing
a distribution.

Plus, since this plugin also adds the '# TRIAL' comment on the version
line, it's obvious in the source that the module is a development release.
With both source and tarball obviously marked "TRIAL", most of the
historical need for underscore in a version is taken care of.

Using decimal underscores (with the "tr" hack ) introduces a subtle
difference between what the C<< MM->parse_version >> thinks the version is
(and what is in META) and what Perl thinks the version is at runtime.

    Foo->VERSION eq MM->parse_version( $INC{"Foo.pm"} )

This would be false for the version "1.002_003" with
C<$VERSION =~ tr/_//d>.  Much of the toolchain has heuristics to
deal with this, but it may be an issue depending on exactly what
version of toolchain modules you have installed.  You can avoid all of
it by just not using underscores.

On the other hand, using underscores and B<not> using the "tr" hack
leads to even worse problems trying to specify a version number with
C<use>:

    # given $Foo::VERSION = "1.002_003"

    use Foo 1.002_003; # fails!

Underscore versions were a useful hack, but now it's time to move on and
leave them behind.  But, if you really insist on underscores, the
C<allow_decimal_underscore> option will let you.

=head2 Using underscore in tuple $VERSION

Yes, Perl allows this: C<v1.2.3_4>.  And even this: C<1.2.3_4>.  And
this: C<v1.2_3>.  Or any of those in quotes.  (Maybe)

But what happens is a random function of your version of Perl, your
version of L<version.pm|version>, and your version of the CPAN toolchain.

So you really shouldn't use underscores in version tuples, and this module
won't let you.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 allow_decimal_underscore

Allows use of decimal versions with underscores.  Default is false.  (Version
tuples with underscores are never allowed!)

=head2 global

If true, all occurrences of the version pattern will be replaced.  Otherwise,
only the first occurrence in each file is replaced.  Defaults to false.

=head2 all_matching

If true, only versions matching that of the last release will be replaced.
Defaults to false.

=head2 munge_makefile_pl

If there is a F<Makefile.PL> in the root of the repository, its version will be
set as well.  Defaults to true.

=head2 munge_build_pl

If there is a F<Build.PL> in the root of the repository, its version will be
set as well.  Defaults to true.
